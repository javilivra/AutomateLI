## Research Query

Show me how is my code?

### Analysis Summary

I need a bit more information to understand what you're asking. "How is my code?" is a very broad question. To give you a helpful answer, I need you to be more specific. For example, are you looking for:

*   **A high-level overview of the architecture?** (e.g., "Explain the main components and how they interact.")
*   **Details about a specific feature or module?** (e.g., "How does the user authentication work?" or "Show me the code related to payment processing.")
*   **Information about a particular function or class?** (e.g., "What does the `calculateTax` function do?" or "Where is the `Order` class defined?")
*   **An assessment of code quality or potential issues?** (e.g., "Are there any performance bottlenecks?" or "Is the code well-tested?")
*   **A summary of the project's structure?** (e.g., "Show me the directory structure.")

Once you provide more details, I can use my tools to analyze your codebase and provide a relevant report.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Need for Specificity**
   The user's initial query "How is my code?" is too broad for a specific answer. To provide a helpful response, more specific information is needed. The system outlines several categories of questions that would allow for a more targeted analysis, such as architectural overviews, details about specific features or modules, information on particular functions or classes, code quality assessments, or project structure summaries. The system indicates that once a more detailed query is provided, it can use its tools to analyze the codebase and generate a relevant report.
